# Espresso funnels
Funnel designs for espresso baskets.

Everything is written in OpenSCAD.
All parameters deviating from default (generally only inner radius and basket rim radius) are set in separate files specific to each basket model.
Nonsemicircular basket rims can also be accommodated (see Caravel basket file).
The example basket shows all default parameters changed.
Comments related to specific baskets reside in each such file.
